Annotating
==========

..  include:: ./editor.rst 


What will be annotated.
-----------------------

Once you've defined your :ref:`taskdefinition`, you and any other annotator will be taken to the annotation view.
Behind the scenes, LightTag will automatically choose the next :ref:`task` to do, based on what the annotator has
already completed and the specifications of the :ref:`taskdefinition`.
