Marking an Example as Done and Submitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LightTag asks annotators to commit to an example being completed annotated. Annotators make this commitment by clicking
*Done*. If there was nothing to annotate in a particular example, then the button will say *Nothing here*.


Using Suggestions

* If suggestions are available, a purple button on the top right will appear that says "SUGGESTIONS".
* Click on this button to enter suggestion mode
* LightTag will highlight its suggestions and there type
* Click the green "V" to accept a suggestion
* Click the red "X" to reject a suggestion
* If you are not sure about a suggestion ignore it
* Click on the purple button again (It now says ANNOTATION) to go back to annotation mode
* You will see the suggestions you accepted as annotations
* Add any missing annotations and continue like before
