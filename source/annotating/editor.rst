      Basic Annotating

The Annotation view will always display the task to be done now. In the center of the screen you'll see the
text to be annotated, to its right the list of :ref:`Tags<tag>` from the tasks :ref:`schema` and a few buttons.

Selecting a Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Tag can be selected by either double clicking on a tag or pressing the keyboard shortcut shown next to the tag.

Removing an Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes we make mistakes. Removing an annotation is simple, just click the red X on it.

      Remove an annotation by clicking on the red X

Marking an Example as Done and Submitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LightTag asks annotators to commit to an example being completed annotated. Annotators make this commitment by clicking
*Done*. If there was nothing to annotate in a particular example, then the button will say *Nothing here*.

      Pressing Done and submitting

.. ATTENTION::
      * Pressing done or nothing here does not save your work. You must press SUBMIT to save your work with LightTag.
      * You'll notice though, that the Submit button is not active until you have commited to each example in the task
        being either *done* or having *nothing here*.
      * After pressing *done* / *nothing here* you will not be able to add or remove annotations
      * If you mistakenly press *done*/*nothing here* You can press *Keep Annotating* to keep annotating.


Using Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If suggestions are availble, a purple button on the top right will appear that says "SUGGESTIONS".
* Click on this button to enter suggestion mode
* LightTag will highlight its suggestions and there type
* Click the green "V" to accept a suggestion
* Click the red "X" to reject a suggestion
* If you are not sure about a suggestion ignore it
* Click on the purple button again (It now says ANNOTATION) to go back to annotation mode
* You will see the suggestions you accepted as annotations
* Add any missing annotations and continue like before
