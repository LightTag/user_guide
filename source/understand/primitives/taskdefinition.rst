TaskDefinition
==============

The beuty of LightTag is that it manages the work to be done, that is the individual :ref:`tasks<task>`. You don't need
to define them or assign them. Instead you only need to define what you want, LightTag will make that happen.

The definition of an annotation project can be said in one sentance
"I want *n* annotaotrs to annotate :ref:`dataset` A with :ref:`tags<tag>` from :ref:`schema` B"
