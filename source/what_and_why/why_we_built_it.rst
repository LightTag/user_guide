Why We Built LightTag
=====================

We built LightTag because we couldn't find an alternative that filled the following criteria

1. No Devops. We wanted to annotate, not manage servers, OS permissions and ports between servers and DB
2. Simple data format. We want our data scientists to easily consume the outcome of our annotations. That means
    storing that outcome in an easy to use format
3. Teams first. We need a lot of annotated data and the way to get there is with a team. We wanted a tool that
    was built from day one for enabling and managing a team of annotators.
4. Data integrity. The asset we are producing is data and we want every possible garauntee on its quality and integrity.
    Other solutions, by virtue of holding data and annotations in seperate places had a harder time enforcing those guarantees.
5. Language Autonomy. We work with "real language" the kind that people speak informally on the internet. It's informal,
    unstructured and often not in english. We needed a tool that made no assumptions about our data.
